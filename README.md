## Book

### A Blazor WASM PWA for recording transactions and viewing balances

#### What Book is:
Book is a project used as a learning experience in various technologies new to me:
- [Blazor WebAssembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)
- [EF Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) backed by a SQLite
 database, _in the browser cache_, with the help of
 [Bit.Besql](https://bitplatform.dev/besql/overview)
- [MudBlazor](https://www.mudblazor.com/) components and UI styling
- [ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com/) Javascript charts via [Blazor-ApexCharts](https://github.com/apexcharts/Blazor-ApexCharts)

It is a browser application that has no back-end services - everything is accomplished 
locally in the browser.
